\subsection{Detailed Description}
This opaque structure is used to maintain the state of a test session with an A\-M\-V\-P server. A single instance of this context represents a test session with the A\-M\-V\-P server. This context is used by the application layer to perform the steps to conduct a test. These steps are\-: 


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Create the context
\item Specify the server hostname
\item Register with the A\-M\-V\-P server
\item Commence the test with the server
\item Return the results
\item Free the context 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
